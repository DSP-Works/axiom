Hey there, thanks for being interested in Axiom!
Axiom is an extremely flexible synthesizer, originally designed for size-
constrained environments such as PC intros in the demoscene. However, it's
entirely open source and is becoming an excellent free tool for any musician.

 - Usage Guide: https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/wiki/Usage-Guide.
 - Example Projects: https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/tree/master/examples


Some features currently available in 0.4.0:
 - VST2 instrument/effect and standalone backends
 - Rich history (undo/redo) support, persists across saves
 - Copy and paste
 - Saving and loading project files, exporting and importing module libraries
 - Automation and sidechaining support
 - A powerful graph editor for ADSR and more
 - A global module library to save and share presets and building blocks

Coming soon:
 - Richer controls: a keyboard and oscilloscope
 - More backends, including VST3 with dynamic I/O support
 - Exporting to executable
 - More stability! (this is where you come in)

Got suggestions for features? Ideas or contributions for the built-in module
library? Bugs? Please don't hesitate to put them up on the issue tracker
(https://github.com/monadgroup/axiom/issues) and we'll look at it ASAP.
